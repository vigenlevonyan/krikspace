# Krik.Space — Random Messages of Support

**$1 — A random phrase that someone wants you to hear**

### The Idea:
You receive a random message recorded by another user. Something like "you can do everything", "I'm proud of you", "don't give up".
In response: you can leave your own message for $1.
Works as a closed chain of support.
